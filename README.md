Opinionated Rust integration for Unreal Engine

## ‚ò£Ô∏è Warning

This project is not ready to be used in a real project. The project is in a very early state and nothing more that a proof of concept right now. The API will change quite frequently. Things might crash, or not work as intended. The user experience will not be great.

I am releasing `unreal-rust` on github to develop it in the open.

## üéØ Features

- **Simple opinionated bindings**: Easy access to core APIs like playing sounds, spawning actors, pathfinding, physics etc. 
- **Developer friendly**: Fast iteration times with hot reloading in the editor and during live play. Panics are caught and do not crash the editor
- **Editor integration**: Add Rust components to actors in the editor, or access Rust components from Blueprint to drive animations. 
- **Entity Component System**: unreal-rust is built on top of an ECS.
- **Built on top of `AActor`**: Most gameplay features like `GameMode`, `Characters`, `GameState`, `GAS` are not directly accessible in unreal-rust. Instead unreal-rust will provide optional alternatives. But you can still interact with most parts of the engine as Rust components can be accessed in Blueprint.
- **No engine modifications**: unreal-rust is only a `Plugin`, just drop it in your project. See [Supported versions](#supported-versions) for more information.
- **Samples**: The development of unreal-rust is heavily driven by samples.
- **Free**: Dual licensed under MIT/APACHE

## üö© Known problems

- No console support. I simply can not offer console support as it is a very closed off ecosystem. Nor do I have access to any developer kits myself.
- This is just a hobby project of mine that I work on outside of my normal work hours. I might be slow to respond to issues, questions, feature requests, or PR reviews.


## ü¶Æ Getting started

### Running the example

_I am aware that these are a lot of steps. I am sorry, I will try to simplify this in the future_

* Prerequisites:
* * [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). For Linux users you can get it [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux)
* * Get [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), and run `git lfs install`
* * [ue4cli](https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli), You can get it with `pip3 install ue4cli`. This step is optional but I will use `ue4cli` in this guide.
* * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

We start by cloning this repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/MaikKlein/unreal-rust
```

Next we clone the submodule. This will download the actual example with all the assets.

```
cd unreal-rust
git submodule update --init
```

Next we need to setup the example

- - Linux `sh setup.sh`
- - Windows `setup.bat`

This will symlink the `RustPlugin` into the unreal `example/RustExample/Plugin` folder.

Now we need to build the actual Rust code:

Simply run

```
cargo build --release
```

This will build whole project. This also produces our dll that we are going to load into Unreal.

Copy the dll/so file into the project 

* Linux: `cp target/release/libunreal_rust_example.so example/RustExample/Binaries/rustplugin.so`
* Windows: `copy .\target\release\unreal_rust_example.dll .\example\RustExample\Binaries\rustplugin.dll`

Now we need to build the unreal example

```
cd example/RustExample
ue4 build Development Editor
```

Now you can run the example with `ue4 run`

## Supported versions

- `5.0`

This project will always try to support the latest version.

- Latest version of Unreal
- Latest version of Rust
- Latest version of all dependencies

## FAQ

### How does the C FFI work?

We define the C FFI inside Rust like `fn set_actor_position(pos: Vec3)`. We generate a C header with bindgen. We then implement `set_actor_position` in C++. When we load the Rust dll from within Unreal, we pass in the function pointers like `set_actor_position` into the Rust dll. This allows Rust to call functions of Unreal.

Additonally we also define and implement C functions in Rust. We then pass the function pointers of those functions into Unreal when the dll is loaded. This allows Unreal to call into Rust. For example Unreal calls `Tick` every frame which is define inside the Rust dll.
