## ‚ò£Ô∏è Warning

This project is not ready to be used in a real project. The project is in a very early state and nothing more that a proof of concept right now. The API will change quite frequently. Things might crash, or not work as intended. The user experience will not be great.

I am releasing `unreal-rust` on github to develop it in the open.

## üéØ Features

- **Simple opinionated bindings**: Easy access to APIs like playing sounds, spawning actors, doing physics while leaving almost the whole gameplay framework behind such as `Pawns`, `Characters`, `GameMode`, `GameState` etc. The API will be closer to Unity.
- **Developer friendly**: Fast iteration times with hot reloading in the editor and during live play both on Windows and Linux. Unable to crash the editor in safe code, all panics are caught and will just throw you out of play mode.
- **Fast**: Built on top of an entity component system.
- **Practical**: `unreal-rust` is not an all or nothing solution. You can still use blueprints if you want to and drive your animation blueprints by reading state out of `unreal-rust`. The example accesses 
- **No magic**: Built on top of simple C FFI. This allows Unreal to call into Rust, and Rust to call into Unreal.
- **Easy to get started**: Simply drop the `RustPlugin` into your projects `Plugin` folder and you are ready to go. No engine modifications necessary.
- **Free**: Dual licensed under MIT/APACHE

## üö© Known problems

- No console support. I simply can not offer console support as it is a very closed off ecosystem. Nor do I have access to any developer kits myself.
- This is just a hobby project of mine that I work on outside of my normal work hours. I might be slow to respond to issues, questions, feature requests, or PR reviews.


## ü¶Æ Getting started

### Running the example

_I am aware that these are a lot of steps. I am sorry, I will try to simplify this in the future_

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/MaikKlein/unreal-rust`
- Make sure to clone the submodules as well `git submodule update --init`

- Run the setup
- - Linux `sh setup.sh`
- - Windows Copy or symlink `RustPlugin` into `examples/RustExample/Plugins`
- Build the rust code
- - `cargo build --release`
- - Copy the dll/so file into the project `cp target/release/libunreal_rust_example.so example/RustExample/Binaries/rustplugin.so`
- - Bonus: You can use `cargo-watch` to automatically rebuild your code on file changes. `cargo watch -i "*.so" -s "cargo build --release; cp target/release/libunreal_rust_example.so example/RustExample/Binaries/rustplugin.so"` You can install it with `cargo install cargo-watch`

- Build `example/RustExample`
- - I recommend installing [ue4cli](https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli)
- - `cd example/RustExample`
- - `ue4 build Development Editor`
- - and run the editor `ue4 run`

### Minimal

- Move the `RustPlugin` folder into your projects `Plugins` folder
- Start with the `example/minimal`
- Run `cargo build --release`. This will produce a C dll in `target/release`
- Copy the dll into the `Binaries` folder of your project, and name it `rustplugin.so`

## Supported versions

- `5.0`

This project will always try to support the latest version.

- Latest version of Unreal
- Latest version of Rust
- Latest version of all dependencies

## FAQ

### Why Rust?

// TODO improve

Splitting gameplay code into a separate dll to improve iteration times could have been done in any language but there are a few reasons why I chose Rust

Rust is an very developer friendly language. It gives you best in class error messages. It has a more strict compiler that catches a lot of errors at compiletime. Easy to use build system. `cargo build` will just work with most project. No need to read instructions.
No segfaults in normal code, crashes or panics are well defined.
Absolute fantastic documentation engine, just run `cargo doc`. Have a look at the [Standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/)
No frills package manager that makes it easy to add external libraries. And because Rust is a safe language, no need to worry that the dependencies you bring in will do bad things (most of the time).
